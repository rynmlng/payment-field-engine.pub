faq_questions:
  - question: "What is an IBAN?"
    answer: "An IBAN (International Bank Account Number) is a standardized international numbering system used to uniquely identify a specific bank account across national borders for the purpose of processing international payments accurately and efficiently. It contains a country code, check digits, and an account number to ensure smooth and error-free cross-border transactions."
  - question: "What is special about an IBAN in Brazil?"
    answer: "Every country's IBAN format is different. Brazil specifically requires a bank identifier with the intermediary Central Bank Of Brazil along with the position of the account holder."
  - question: "When would I need to generate an IBAN?"
    answer: "If the payment processor you are working with requires an IBAN and you only have other bank fields then it's necessary to generate an IBAN."
