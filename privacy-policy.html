Welcome to Bank Code Tools ("we," "our," or "us"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.

<strong>1. Information We Collect</strong>

We collect only the specific banking data you provide to us for the purpose of performing bank account computations. This includes bank account numbers, bank codes, branch codes, BIC SWIFTs, IBANs, and indicators such as whether you are the primary account holder. We do not collect any personal identifiers such as names, email addresses, or other contact details during this process.

<strong>2. How We Use Your Information</strong>

Your data is transmitted securely and processed only temporarily through an encrypted AWS Lambda service to perform the requested computations. We do not store, log, or share the input data with any third parties. The computation happens in memory, and all data is discarded immediately after processing.

<strong>3. Data Security</strong>

We employ HTTPS/SSL encryption to protect all data transfers between your device and our servers. Our back-end processes do not persist any data, and no values appear in server logs, ensuring your information remains confidential and secure.

<strong>4. Data Retention</strong>

We do not retain any banking data submitted to our site. All data is processed in real-time and immediately discarded after the computation completes.

<strong>5. User Rights</strong>

Since the site does not create user accounts or store your information, rights to access, modify, or delete your data are not applicable. However, you have the right to contact us regarding any concerns about your data privacy.

<strong>6. Cookies and Tracking</strong>

Our site does not use cookies, tracking technologies, or analytics tools that collect personal or behavioral data.

<strong>7. International Users</strong>

Our services are available internationally, and we aim to comply with all applicable data protection laws. If you are concerned about privacy regulations applicable in your country, please review local laws or contact us for more information.

<strong>8. Contact Us</strong>

<strong>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong>

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most recent version will always be posted on this page with the updated revision date.
